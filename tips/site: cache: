Using the advanced “site:” search operator, it is possible to restrict
search results to a specific domain [2]. Do not limit testing to just
one search engine provider as they may generate different results
depending on when they crawled content and their own algorithms.
Consider using the following search engines:
• Baidu
• binsearch.info
• Bing
• Duck Duck Go
• ixquick/Startpage
• Google
• Shodan
• PunkSpider

PunkSpider is web application vulnerability search engine. It is of lit-
tle use for a penetration tester doing manual work. However it can
be useful as demonstration of easiness of finding vulnerabilities by
script-kiddies.
